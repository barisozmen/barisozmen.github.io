## Review Papers
Convergent Software Peer Review Practices ([Microsoft Research paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/convergent-software-peer-review-practices/)) -> *"We examine two Google lead projects, Android and Chrome, three Microsoft projects, Bing, Office, and MS SQL, and one project internal to AMD. We contrast our findings with data taken from traditional software inspection conducted on a Lucent project, a compiler, and from open source software peer review on six projects, including Apache, Linux, and KDE"*
