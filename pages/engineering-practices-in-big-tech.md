# Engineering practices in big tech

## Google
* <ins>Eng. Practices Guide ([wiki](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/))</ins>
   * **Software development**
     * development always at "head"
     * code ownership
     * hermetic build system
     * must review minimum one other engineer
     * encourage small changes (CLs labeled as S,M,L,XL)
     * Buganizer, bug tracking system. bug triage practices
     * insists on using limited number of (5) programming languages: C++, Java, Python, Go, JavaScript
          * reduces obstacles to code reuse and programmer collaboration
          * Protocol buffers for interoperating between different programming languages
          * single command set for usual tasks no matter which language (e.g. check out, edit, build, commit, file bug, ...)
      * canary services
      * post-mortems
      * Frequent software re-writes (1-2 years) !!
          * benefits worth the cost
          * requirements change significantly in few years in a typical project, software designed around old requirements is most of the time not optimal for current requirements
          * software accumulates complexity over years
          * increases sense of ownership of new engineers in the project
          * encourages mobility of engineers between projects
          * ensure code is written in recent tech and methodology
    * **Project management**
       * allows spending 20% time on any project
       * OKRs
    * **People management**
       * Roles
          * tech leadership and people management distinction
          * searate career progression for engineering and management
          * Engineering manager
             * selects tech leads, responsible for team performance, coaching assistance in career development, performance evaluation, some aspects of compensation and hiring
             * manages 3 to 30 people. 8 to 12 is most common
          * SWE
          * Research scientist
          * SRE
          * Product manager
          * Program manager / Technical program manager
            * similar to product manager, but rather than product, manages processes (e.g. data collection)
    * **Facilities**
      * open plan seatings
        * Pros: encourage communation, economical
        * Cons: less concentration.
        * Blog arguing against open offices ([blog](https://stackoverflow.blog/2015/01/16/why-we-still-believe-in-private-offices/))
           * research/news might suggest open office is a bad idea: [damages productivity](https://www.dezeen.com/2014/11/21/open-plan-office-designs-unpopular-with-workers-damage-productivity/), [less satisfaction](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0013916502034003001), [open-office trap](https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-open-office-trap)

* <ins>Why Google Stores Billions of Lines of Code in a Single Repo ([talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W71BTkUbdqE))</ins>
   * Trunk-based development
   * Advantages of a monolithic repo
      * single source of truth
      * diamond dependency problem
      * easier to modernize codebase
   * tooling support
      * code review, code search, tricorder, presubmits, testing before and after commit, auto roll-back, change distribution and management
   * Warning: this may or may not be the right approach for your company

    * *"We examine two Google lead projects, Android and Chrome, three Microsoft projects, Bing, Office, and MS SQL, and one project internal to AMD. We contrast our findings with data taken from traditional software inspection conducted on a Lucent project, a compiler, and from open source software peer review on six projects, including Apache, Linux, and KDE"*
