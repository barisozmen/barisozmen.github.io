# Best practices for writing engineering blogposts

My blogpost : [Auto-ML for data augmentation](https://blog.insightdatascience.com/automl-for-data-augmentation-e87cf692c366)


- Make a title summarizing best what reader will read
- Put an image in the beginning, both appealing, and give an idea on the blogpost
- Put a summary in the beginning which shoud be: TL;DR + 4-6 lines summary of what is in blogpost. Reader will decide to continue or not depending on summary. Think behalf of the reader.
   - Reader should understand for what he will spend his next 10-15 minutes.
   - Aim is catching readers whose interests allow them to spend 10+ minutes
- Allow every type of reader to get best benefit per seconds from the blogpost. Reader types:
   - **5 seconds spender** -> should get the main conclusion from TL,DR
   - **3 mins spender** -> should get outlines of the post by reading summary + subtitles + figures/tables + conclusion
   - **15 mins spender**
- Each subtitle should state the conclusion from each content
- If you can explain anything with a table or plot, just do it
- concise speech
