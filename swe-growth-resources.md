## How to read source code
 - Download the interested source code and run on your machine
 - Start playing with the tool, try using it with all functionalities, test the edge cases, try finding not well performing queries/functionalities
 - Run a command, and follow the stacktrace
 - Run another command and follow/read stacktrace again
 - Continue like that, softwares usually have a layered structure, so best way to understand what's going on is following the stacktrace, instead of reading from the repo.

## Promotions
  - **Software Engineering Promotions: Advice to Get to That Next Level** ([blogpost](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-promotions/))
     - Do Your Preparation
       - Understand the promotion process at your company
       - Assess yourself
       - Get your manager on your side
          - (It is in the best interest of your manager for you to be promoted - when you are ready.)
       - Be realistic in promotions above the senior bar (i.e. promotions becoming exponentially harder when leveling up)
     - Set your sight on the promotion
       - Set goals to close the gap on areas you lack for the next level
       - Act and take responsibility like you're already at the next level
       - Keep a log of your achievements and impact
     - Get help & frequent feedback
       - Get a mentor in the company, to help you ([his blogpost on mentoring](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/developers-mentoring-other-developers/))
       - Ask for regular, explicit feedback
     - Put in the work
       - Don't alienate your peers
       - Don't kick back, even when you feel things are in your pocket
     - Stay grounded
       - Don't believe anyone who promises you a "sure promotion."
       - Don't have promotion be your only goal 
         - (i.e If your primary goals are about professional growth, even if you are not promoted, you will have gained valuable skills.)
       - Promotion is not the only way to get positive feedback
       - Stay patient and be positive. It's a long game.
     - Help others
