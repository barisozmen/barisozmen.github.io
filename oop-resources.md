## Object oriented programming (OOP) resources

SOLID ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)):
  * **Single responsibility principle**
     * a class should have only a single responsibility (i.e. changes to only one part of the software's 
       specification should be able to affect the specification of the class).
  * **Open/closed principle**
     * "software entities â€¦ should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
  * **Liskov substitution principle**
     * "objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program." See also design by contract.
  * **Interface segregation principle**
     * "many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."
  * **Dependency inversion principle**
     * one should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."
